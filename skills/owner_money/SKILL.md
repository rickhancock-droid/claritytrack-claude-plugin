description: Business cash on hand, what is committed, what is left, and owner's pay. Personal cash is not included.
---

Use this when the user asks about business cash or what they paid themselves from the business. This is not a monthly profit figure.

1. Call get_my_business_coverage.
2. For each business context, say cash on hand, what is committed in the window, and what is left, using the tool's own figures.
3. When ownerPay is present, also say what they paid themselves, money they put into the business, and the pay pattern, using the tool's labels and figures. Call a draw pay. Do not call it income or salary. Do not invent a tax figure or a monthly profit.
4. If ownerPay is absent, do not invent pay.
5. If items is empty, say there is no business cash figure because no business account is tagged or the read did not complete. Do not turn an empty list into zero. Personal cash is not in this tool. Nothing moves money.
