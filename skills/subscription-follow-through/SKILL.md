description: Whether a cancelled subscription's charge actually stopped, or a charge posted after the cancellation.

Use this when the user asks whether a cancelled subscription's charge stopped.

1. Call subscriptions.follow_through. Do not use subscription.status. That tool is the ClarityTrack plan tier.
2. Say the charge stopped only when a request status is confirmed_stopped.
3. charge_detected means a charge posted after the request. committed means it is still waiting. A missing charge before the next bill date is not a stop.
4. chargedAfterCancellation means a charge posted after the stream was marked cancelled.
5. If there is no cancelled stream and no request, say there is nothing to confirm. Nothing moves money.

Write the answer in plain text. Use no emoji, coloured dots, check marks or other symbols, and no em or en dashes. Say a status in words, such as ahead, on track or behind.
